This Python code implements a custom voice assistant that utilizes the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries to facilitate voice input and output.
The assistant is capable of performing various functions, including managing a to-do list by adding and listing tasks, providing real-time weather updates through
the OpenWeatherMap API, and simulating smart home light control. Additionally, it can greet users and report the current time. The core functionality is encapsulated in 
several dedicated methods, such as speak(), listen(), and handle_query(), which together create an interactive and user-friendly experience. The assistant operates in an infinite loop, 
continuously listening for voice commands and responding to user queries,
sh5owcasing the versatility and applicability of Python in developing personal automation tools.
